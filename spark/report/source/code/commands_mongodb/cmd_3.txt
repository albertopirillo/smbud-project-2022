    "abstract": "Managers in modern organizations are confronted with ever-increasing volumes of information that they must evaluate when making a decision. Data warehousing and data mining technologies have given managers a number of valuable tools that can help them store, retrieve, and analyze information contained in large databases; however, maximizing user performance with these tools remains a challenge for information systems professionals. [. . .] These results have important implications for the design of managerial decision-making systems, particularly in complex decision-making environments.",

In Hong Kong, an algorithm organizes the underground's maintenance schedule and assigns repair jobs to service technicians (Hodson, 2014).",
